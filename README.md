**Project:**** Real-Time Weather Monitoring System with Rollups and Aggregates (Using OpenWeatherMap API)**
This project implements a real-time weather monitoring system that retrieves data from the OpenWeatherMap API for major Indian cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad). 
**Features:**
1. Real-time data retrieval: Continuously fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API at configurable intervals.
2. Temperature conversion: Converts Kelvin to Celsius.
3. Daily summaries: Calculates daily average, maximum, minimum temperature, and dominant weather condition.
4. Alerting thresholds: Monitors weather data against user-defined thresholds and triggers alerts upon violations.
4. Visualizations: Provides visualizations for daily summaries, historical trends, and alerts.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.x: Programming language,
OpenWeatherMap API key:a free API key from https://openweathermap.org/,
Database: For storing daily summaries (SQLite3),
Visualization library:: For generating visualizations (Matplotlib).
